# Welcome to the Journey

Hi, I’m Cory Keller, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep passion for all things digital defense. Over the years, I’ve worked as a Penetration Tester, Incident Response Analyst, and Security Engineer. Each role has taken me to incredible places, both geographically and professionally, and I’ve had the privilege of learning from some of the best minds in the field, as well as the kind of hands-on experience you can’t get from books alone.

This blog is my new digital home, a fresh start after losing my previous content, where I plan to share my experiences, sharpen my technical skills, and hopefully provide something valuable to others along the way. Whether you’re just starting out in cybersecurity or you’ve been in the trenches for years, my goal is to make this a space for learning and exploration.

Unlike many blogs out there, this won’t be a news hub. I won’t cover trending stories unless I’m directly involved in something newsworthy. I strongly believe that content creators should speak from experience, not just repackage headlines. There's a lot of noise in our field, and I’d rather add signal.

Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of Machine Learning (ML), and it’s been quite a ride. I see ML as a powerful tool for cybersecurity, offering exciting possibilities for detection, automation, and defense. It’s a space where I’ve already learned a ton, and I can’t wait to share that learning with you.

Thanks for being here. Let’s dig in, learn together, and make the most of this journey.
